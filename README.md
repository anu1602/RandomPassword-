# RandomPasswordGenerator-
using HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
Random Password Generator is a JavaScript project that can generate strong and unique passwords automatically. I made a box on everyone's first web page. I have used a heading or title. Below the header is an input box where the password can be generated. 
The unit password will be generated each time you click the Generate button. I have used JavaScript Math. random and Math. floor method.
